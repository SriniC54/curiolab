## Phase 0 — Planning & setup

- [x] **#1 Draft pivot plan document** ✅
  Plan captured in `PIVOT_PLAN.md`. Covers role rename, validator loop, visibility model, MVP scope, deferred items, and rollback path.

- [x] **#2 Publish plan as GitHub Gist** ✅
  Secret Gist live at https://gist.github.com/SriniC54/39c097a6898f7fd93feb13fad18f0095

- [x] **#3 Archive pre-pivot branch + start working branch** ✅
  `pre-pivot-archive` snapshots `main` at `eff1645`. `pivot/creator-flow` is the working branch.

## Phase 1 — Data model foundation

- [x] **#4 Add `content_items` table + migration** ✅
  New table: id, creator_id, topic, skill_level, draft_content (JSON), final_content (JSON), validator_feedback (text), iteration_count, status (`draft`/`validated`/`published`), visibility (`private`/`assigned`/`public`), timestamps, deleted_at (soft-delete). Indexes on `(creator_id, deleted_at)`, `status`, `visibility`. Idempotent migration in `init_database()`. Verified on a clean DB: re-runs safe, defaults apply, JSON round-trips, soft-delete filters correctly.

- [x] **#5 Rename role `teacher` → `creator`** ✅
  Idempotent `UPDATE users SET role='creator' WHERE role='teacher'` added to `init_database()`. Backend: `require_teacher` → `require_creator` (function + 13 endpoint dependencies), validation tuple, error messages. Frontend: TS types in `AuthContext`, `AuthModal` (state + click handler + button label), role checks in `index.tsx`, `learn/[topic].tsx`, `teacher-dashboard.tsx`. Verified end-to-end: 'teacher' rows convert cleanly, idempotent on re-run, content_items table coexists. Cosmetic cleanup (route paths, column names, file rename, comments) tracked separately as task #21.

- [x] **#6 Link `batch_topics` to `content_item_id`** ✅
  Additive `ALTER TABLE batch_topics ADD COLUMN content_item_id INTEGER REFERENCES content_items(id)` wrapped in try/except for idempotency. Nullable so legacy rows survive untouched; new assignments (task #15) will populate it. Index `idx_batch_topics_content_item` for the JOIN path. Tightening to NOT NULL or `UNIQUE(batch_id, content_item_id)` requires a SQLite table rebuild — deferred to task #21. Verified on a fresh DB: legacy NULL rows preserved, linked rows JOIN cleanly to content_items, query plan uses the index, second migration run is a no-op.

## Phase 2 — Backend validator + generation loop

- [x] **#7 Implement validator critique function** ✅
  `validate_content_draft(draft, topic, skill_level)` in `backend/main.py`. Single Gemini call with `response_mime_type="application/json"` and thinking enabled (budget 2048). Six internal dimensions: accuracy, grade_level, bias, completeness, age_appropriate, safety — "politically correct" folded into bias since they collapse to the same fair-representation concern. Dimension framework is invisible to creators; the `summary` field is conversational and mentions only dimensions with a `concern` verdict (named in plain language, never as the rubric label). Returns `{dimensions, summary, needs_revision}`. Defensive shape validation; on any upstream failure returns a permissive default so the orchestrator never blocks behind a flaky reviewer. Standalone — wiring lands in #9.

- [x] **#8 Implement revision function** ✅
  `revise_content_draft(draft, critique, topic, skill_level)` in `backend/main.py`. Consumes the structured `dimensions` from the validator (not the conversational `summary`) so the revision model gets the full per-dimension signal. Filters to only the dimensions with `concern` verdict — pass dimensions are noise. Hard rules in the prompt: address every flagged issue, preserve section structure (headings + emoji + paragraph shape + ~900 words), do not rewrite unflagged parts, output the full revised draft only (no commentary or diff format). Temperature 0.5 (between generator's 0.7 and validator's 0.2), thinking off (validator already reasoned). Graceful degradation: returns the original draft on any upstream failure so the orchestrator's next validate pass surfaces the unchanged content + actionable feedback instead of an error. Smoke test deferred to task #9 since revision is only meaningful in the validate→revise→validate chain.

- [x] **#9 Wire generate→validate→revise orchestrator** ✅
  `orchestrate_content_creation(creator_id, topic, skill_level)` in `backend/main.py`. Hardcoded `MAX_REVISIONS = 2`. Loop: generate → validate → (revise → validate)×N until clean or cap. Persists a `content_items` row with `creator_id`, `topic`, `skill_level`, `draft_content` (the FIRST draft, for debugging), `final_content` (post-revision), `validator_feedback` (full final critique JSON), `iteration_count`, `status='draft'`, `visibility='private'`. First-draft generation failure raises (no draft = nothing to show); validator/revision failures absorbed by their permissive defaults so the loop always reaches persist. SQLite write failures surface — silent persist failure would create a successful-looking generate that never appears in the library. Sections / images / quiz NOT generated here — punted to task #16 (lazy-load when student opens assignment) so creators don't wait for assets they may regenerate away. Cheap observability via `_log_pass()` printing concern dimensions at each pass. Smoke test in `backend/test_orchestrator.py` (gitignored) covers easy topic + tricky topic; confirms row lands in DB with correct shape.

- [ ] **#10 Add `POST /creator/content/generate` endpoint** ⬜
  Creator-authenticated. Runs orchestrator, returns content_item id + payload to frontend.

## Phase 3 — Creator UI

- [ ] **#11 Replace homepage with sign-up funnel** ⬜
  Remove student topic-browse. Marketing landing + Sign up / Sign in CTAs. Role-aware routing post-auth.

- [ ] **#12 Build `/create` page with loading UX** ⬜
  Topic input, skill_level selector, Generate button. Modern skeleton/card-shaped loading state for the 20–40s orchestrator run.

- [ ] **#13 Build content review screen** ⬜
  Final content + single validator narrative + 4 actions: Regenerate · Save to library · Assign to students · Publish public.

- [ ] **#14 Build `/library` page for creators** ⬜
  Lists creator's content_items with topic, skill_level, visibility badge, created date. Click to re-open / re-assign / change visibility.

- [ ] **#15 Update creator dashboard assign flow** ⬜
  Pick from library instead of typing a topic string. Assigns specific `content_item_id` to batch/students.

## Phase 4 — Student consumption

- [ ] **#16 Switch `/learn` to fetch stored content** ⬜
  `pages/learn/[topic].tsx` resolves to a stored `content_item` by id (via assignment lookup). Removes generate-on-demand fallback for students.

- [ ] **#17 End-to-end test student consumption flow** ⬜
  Full round-trip: creator signs up → generates → assigns → student signs in → opens assignment → reads/listens → takes quiz → score recorded.

## Phase 5 — Visibility wiring & cleanup

- [ ] **#18 Wire visibility states through UI + backend** ⬜
  `private` (library only), `assigned` (existing flow, points at content_item_id), `public` (flag set; no MVP browse surface). Endpoints + UI toggles.

- [ ] **#19 Remove `content_cache/` JSON layer** ⬜
  Rip out backend cache writes/reads. Content lives only in `content_items` going forward.

## Followups (post-MVP cleanup)

- [ ] **#20 Rotate GitHub PAT + move out of remote URL** ⬜
  Revoke embedded PAT, generate new one, move into a credential helper (`gh auth login`, `git-credential-manager`, or osxkeychain). Sanity grep for stray tokens before closing out.

## Out of scope for MVP (deferred to V2)

- Parent chatbot for iterative content feedback
- Public browse / search on the homepage
- Creator monetization / attribution
- Per-dimension validator UI breakdown
- Validator pass on quiz content
