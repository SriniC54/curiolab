Even though dragons are make-believe, people have imagined many different things they might eat:\n\n🍖 **Meat and Fish**\nMany stories say dragons love to eat large animals like cattle, sheep, and big fish from rivers and lakes.\n\n💎 **Shiny Treasures**\nSome dragons in stories eat gold, gems, and other sparkly things. They might swallow coins like candy!\n\n🔥 **Fire Food**\nFire-breathing dragons might eat coal, wood, or anything that burns to keep their fire hot.\n\n🌿 **Plants and Fruits**\nNot all dragons eat meat! Some gentle dragons prefer giant fruits, magical herbs, or even whole trees.\n\n🏰 **Castle Food**\nIn fairy tales, dragons sometimes raid castle kitchens for bread, cheese, and royal feasts.\n\nRemember, dragons are imaginary, so people can imagine them eating anything they want in their stories! What would you feed a friendly dragon?",
